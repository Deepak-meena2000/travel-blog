                Before entering Malaysia, check the visa requirements based on your nationality. Many travelers can enter visa-free for 14 to 90 days. However, all foreign visitors irrespective of visa requirement must complete the Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC).

        description: `

            Malaysia Digital Arrival Card(MDAC), a mandatory online form that all foreign travelers, except Singapore, must complete before entering Malaysia. It's not a visa but a required registration document that streamlines entry procedures and improves border security.
            <br/>
            <br/>
<b>All foreign visitors must complete the Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC) online within 3 days before arrival.</b> You can submit the MDAC on the <a href="https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-teal-600">official immigration website</a>. It’s a quick, free and mandatory process that streamlines immigration clearance. Make sure your passport is valid for at least six months.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're arriving by land—such as from Thailand or Singapore—the visa and MDAC requirements still apply. Always carry a printed copy or a screenshot of your approved MDAC for smoother processing at airport or land border checkpoints.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Important: </b>Do not fill out the MDAC form earlier than 3 days before your arrival. It must be submitted within the 3 days leading up to your travel date

        <b>Malaysia uses the Malaysian Ringgit (MYR)</b>.

        <br/>
        <br/>
1 USD equals roughly RM4.5.
<br/>
<br/>
Exchange money at licensed money changers in malls or city centers for the best rates. Avoid airport kiosks and hotels as they offer poor exchange rates. ATMs are a safe option for direct withdrawals. Always check for hidden fees and ensure the exchanger is authorized and regulated.
<br/>
<br/>
Malaysia is a <b>budget-friendly</b> destination, especially for street food, local transport, and mid-range stays. Backpackers can spend under <b>RM200/day</b>, while mid-range travelers spend around <b>RM300–500/day</b>. Costs can rise in tourist-heavy zones like islands or during peak travel seasons, so budget accordingly.

        Malaysia has a tropical climate, so it's <b>hot and humid year-round</b>. However, the best time to visit depends on the region.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        For most of Peninsular Malaysia, the dry season runs from <b>November to August</b>, making it ideal for outdoor travel and beach destinations.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The <b>East Coast (e.g., Perhentian Islands, Redang)</b> experiences heavy monsoons from <b>November to January</b>. In <b>Sabah and Sarawak</b>, dry months vary slightly, but March to September is generally pleasant.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Mountain areas like <b>Cameron Highlands</b> remain cooler throughout the year, offering a refreshing escape from the tropical heat.

        Malaysia has excellent mobile coverage across cities and tourist areas. Major telecom providers include <b>Hotlink (Maxis), Digi, Celcom, and U Mobile.</b>
<br />
<br />
You can easily purchase a <b>tourist SIM card</b> at airports, convenience stores, or mobile kiosks. 4G coverage is strong in most places, and 5G is expanding in major cities. Plans are affordable — expect to pay around RM20–RM50 for 7–unlimited GB of data.
<br />
<br />
Wi-Fi is available in hotels, cafes, and shopping malls. If you're exploring remote areas or islands, the signal may be weaker, so download maps or important info in advance.

            The national language is Bahasa Malaysia (Malay), but English is widely spoken, especially in urban centers, tourist areas, and by younger generations.
            <br />
            <br />
            You’ll also hear Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tamil, reflecting Malaysia’s multicultural heritage. Road signs and public information are often bilingual, in Malay and English. Learning a few basic Malay phrases like “terima kasih” (thank you) or “selamat pagi” (good morning) can enhance your travel experience. Most locals are friendly and appreciate visitors who make an effort. Language won't be a major barrier during your trip in Malaysia.
