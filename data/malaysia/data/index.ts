                Malaysia’s rich tapestry of culture and history is one of its most fascinating aspects and a key reason travelers are drawn to the country. A melting pot of <b>Malay, Chinese, Indian</b> and <b>indigenous</b> influences, Malaysia offers a vibrant cultural experience unlike any other in Southeast Asia.
                You’ll see this diversity reflected in its <b>festivals, food, languages, and religions</b>. Islam is the official religion, but Malaysia also celebrates Diwali, Chinese New Year, and Christmas.
                <br />
                <br />
                Respect local customs: dress modestly when visiting mosques or temples, remove shoes before entering homes or religious places, and avoid public displays of affection. Islam is the dominant religion, and it's wise to be mindful of religious practices, especially during Ramadan.
                <br />
                <br />
                Traditional values are strong, especially in rural areas. Learning about the culture enhances your appreciation of Malaysia’s heritage.

Many travelers can enter visa-free for 14 to 90 days. For longer stays or for nationalities requiring a visa, apply online via the <b>eVisa or eNTRI</b> systems, which are straightforward and quick.

            Malaysia Digital Arrival Card(MDAC), a mandatory online form that all foreign travelers, except Singapore, must complete before entering Malaysia. It's not a visa but a required registration document that streamlines entry procedures and improves border security.
            <br/>
            <br/>
<b>All foreign visitors must complete the Malaysia Digital Arrival Card (MDAC) online within 3 days before arrival.</b> You can submit the MDAC on the <a href="https://imigresen-online.imi.gov.my/mdac/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-teal-600">official immigration website</a>. It’s a quick, free and mandatory process that streamlines immigration clearance. Make sure your passport is valid for at least six months.
<br/>
<br/>
If you're arriving by land—such as from Thailand or Singapore—the visa and MDAC requirements still apply. Always carry a printed copy or a screenshot of your approved MDAC for smoother processing at airport or land border checkpoints.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Important: </b>Do not fill out the MDAC form earlier than 3 days before your arrival. It must be submitted within the 3 days leading up to your travel date
