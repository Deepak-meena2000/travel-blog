The city is a living museum, where <b>Chinese clan houses, Indian temples, Muslim mosques, and British-built churches coexist harmoniously.</b> This cultural blend is reflected in local customs, festivals, languages, and, most notably, food. The population is a vibrant mix of Malays, Chinese, Indians, and Eurasians, each contributing to Penang’s identity. Events like Chinese New Year, Thaipusam, and George Town Festival highlight this diversity. Heritage conservation efforts have helped <b>George Town earn its UNESCO World Heritage status.</b> `,
