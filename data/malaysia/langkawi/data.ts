      description: `
    The <b>best time to visit Langkawi</b> is during the dry season from <b>November to April</b>, when sunny skies and calm seas make for perfect beach days, island hopping, and outdoor adventures. During these months, daytime temperatures average <b>28°C–32°C</b>, with low rainfall, ideal for cable car rides, jungle treks, and mangrove tours.
    <br />
    <br />
    Avoid the <b>monsoon season</b> from <b>May to October</b>, when heavy rains and rough seas can disrupt ferries, tours, attractions(SkyBridge) and water activities though you may find lower hotel prices.
    <br />
    <br />
    If you don’t mind occasional showers, <b>September and October</b> offer quieter beaches and discounted accommodations (up to <b>30% off</b>  ).
    <br />
    <br />
    For cultural immersion, plan your visit around local festivals like <b>Hari Raya Aidilfitri</b> (dates vary annually) and the <b>Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition (LIMA)</b> in <b>March</b>, which showcase vibrant celebrations and draw aviation and maritime enthusiasts worldwide.

      <li><b>Stay Connected:</b> Buy a local prepaid SIM (Digi or Maxis) at the airport for cheap data and reliable coverage across the island.</li>
      <br />
      <li><b>Rent Wisely:</b> Scooter rentals (RM40–RM60/day) are the cheapest way to get around, inspect brakes and lights before you ride.</li>
      <br />
      <li><b>Hydrate & Protect:</b> The tropical sun is intense—carry a refillable water bottle, apply reef-safe sunscreen (SPF 30+), and wear a wide-brim hat.</li>
      <br />
      <li><b>Beat the Heat:</b> Plan outdoor activities early (8–11 AM) or late afternoon (4–6 PM) to avoid peak midday temperatures and sudden rain.</li>
      <br />
      <li><b>Carry Cash:</b> Many street stalls and boat operators don’t accept cards—keep small denominations (RM1, RM5, RM10) for night markets and tips.</li>
      <br />
      <li><b>Pack Smart:</b> Bring lightweight, quick-dry clothing, insect repellent for jungle treks, and a waterproof pouch for your electronics on boat tours.</li>
      <br />
      <li><b>Book Tours Ahead:</b> Popular activities like island hopping, mangrove tours, and the cable car sell out in peak season—reserve at least two weeks in advance.</li>

      <li><b>🛍️ Duty-Free Deals:</b> Take advantage of duty-free prices on chocolates, liquor, and cosmetics—but check your home country’s import limits before you stock up.</li>
